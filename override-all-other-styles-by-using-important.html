I've learned about the priority of CSS styling, by adding "!important" keyword to our class so in this way if there were more then one class or styles 
were given to the HTML element but ultimately class will win which includes '!important'.

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  #orange-text {
    color: orange;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink !important;
  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 id="orange-text" class="pink-text blue-text" style="color: white">Hello World!</h1>
