I understand that, what are the styling priorities, I mean we can't give more than one style to a single element at the same time. 

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text">Hello World!</h1>
